## ML-Study-Jam

Welcome to the **ML-Study-Jam** repository, a collaborative learning initiative organized by the TensorFlow User Group Durg. This repository is designed to support participants through various stages of their machine learning journey, from basics to more advanced topics.

### Overview

The ML-Study-Jam is a structured learning program that includes:

- **Hands-on Assignments**: Practical exercises and projects.
- **Tutoring Sessions**: Guidance and support from experienced mentors.
- **Tech Talks**: Expert sessions to deepen your understanding.
- **Group Discussions**: Collaborative learning with peers.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders corresponding to the various sessions and days of the study jam:

- **Day-1 Intro to Python and Numpy**: Basics of Python programming and an introduction to Numpy.
- **Day-2 Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis using Pandas.
- **Day-3 Math Club**: Foundational mathematics for machine learning.
- **Day-4 Intro to ML**: Core concepts and techniques in machine learning.
- **Day-5 Linear Regression**: Detailed study and implementation of linear regression.

Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks and other resources to help you follow along with the sessions.
